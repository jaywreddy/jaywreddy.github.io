## Notice

This is my personal site. It is currently under construction, so I make no claims as to its functionality or accuracy. I hope to eventually use it to share my work and musings in an open and accessible format. Please feel free to share and reproduce my work with attribution. Enjoy!


## My Background

Hello! My name is Jay Reddy, I'm a developer and currently a PhD student at CMU studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## History of this Site

In 2014, during my Sophomore year at UC Berkeley, I was introduced to $$\LaTeX$$ by [David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) during an [Algorithms](http://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/fa14/) class and began using it to create beautiful homework assignment submissions. 

$$\LaTeX$$, in case you didn't know, is a wonderful text markup language that allows for easy math formatting (with a formidable learning curve), and a separation of content from formatting. 

By my Junior year, I was writing all of my assignments and most of my notes in $$\LaTeX$$ which simultaneously alleviated the strain of my chicken scratch handwriting on my professors and contributed to its severity. 

Senior year, I started experimenting with $$\LaTeX$$ embedded in Markdown. The Markdown syntax is much simpler for basic formatting tasks and many flavors support inline $$\LaTeX$$ for math and complex formatting. Notably, compilers such as Pandoc and Kramdown support output targets besides PDF, allowing me to publish material in more accessible formats, such as this site! 

I am creating this site to archive some of my undergraduate work and document my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University.
