Hello! My name is Jay Reddy, I'm a developer and currently a PhD student at CMU studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.

This is my personal site. It is currently under construction, but I hope to eventually use it to share my work and musings in an accessible format. Enjoy!

Much thanks to jglovier for the Jekyll new theme, which I have modified to create my site.
